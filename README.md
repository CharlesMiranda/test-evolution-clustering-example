# About

This repository contains practical examples of test evolution clustering in software repositories, using Python. Analyzing the evolution of tests is an important approach to understanding how changes in production code and tests interact over time. This helps identify maintenance patterns, quality improvements, and detect risk areas in software projects.

## Objective

The objective of this repository is to provide educational examples demonstrating how to group and analyze test evolution in software projects using clustering techniques. These examples can serve as a starting point for research and experiments in the co-evolution of tests and code.

## Content

- **Clustering scripts in Python**: Implementations using popular machine learning and data analysis libraries, such as Scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.
- **Sample data**: Datasets extracted from real software repositories to perform test evolution clustering.
- **Visualizations**: Charts and visualizations of the clusters to facilitate understanding of the detected patterns.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with suggestions, fixes, or new examples.
